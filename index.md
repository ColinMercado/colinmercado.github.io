## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3 Part 1
I enjoyed working through this Lab because this was one of my first times coding and working through a problem like this and also since I got to have a feel with working with a partner and communicating through it. I can also appreciate this Lab as it has real world implications as well and I could even use this code to use on myself and get proper results. Looking back at this Lab I can appreciate it a lot since it gave me a good understanding for what I would be challenged with to come and I feel that it also set me up well for the rest of the semester.

* Lab 10 Part 1

I really enjoyed this Lab because this is where we started working with 2D arrays and those are very intruguing to work with and think about. This Lab was definitely not easy hence the 2D vector but at the same time that made it very satisfying once completed. Part-2 also dealt with a 2D array but I liked the way that Part-1 was formatted better.

* Lab 11 Part 1 and 2

I would say that this Lab as a whole was my favorite Lab as it was my first introduction apart from our readings about Object-Oriented Programing. I liked how the Lab showed me how you can form and use constructors and I can't wait to work with them more as it was fun to work through and think about them. Working through this Lab with my partner was a great experience and it was very satisfying to complete and see it work correctly.
